    <p>Hello! I’m Daivi, a student at the University of Toronto studying Applied Data Science and Psychology. I’m currently a Consulting Fellow at Propel Impact, Research Director at CUBS, and Co-Founder of a startup built through the UofT Hatchery.</p>
    <p>I combine technical skills in Python and Tableau with a passion for behavioral research, systems thinking, and mental health advocacy. I’ve launched social ventures like The Inky Sunshine, spoken at global conferences, and consulted for real clients with 180DC.</p>
    <p>Let’s connect and collaborate on building a more data-driven, equitable future.</p>
